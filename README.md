# S3Bucket

by [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://humanwhocodes.com)

If you find this useful, please consider supporting my work with a [donation](https://humanwhocodes.com/donate).

## Description

Lightweight JavaScript helper for making signed S3 requests using aws4fetch. Provides a
small `S3Bucket` class with convenience methods for common object operations
(`head`, `get`, `put`, `delete`).

## Installation

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install @humanwhocodes/s3bucket
```

## Usage

Import and create an `S3Bucket` instance. The constructor requires a
`baseUrl` and `bucket` and accepts AWS credentials or the usual
environment-based mechanisms.

```js
import { S3Bucket } from "@humanwhocodes/s3bucket";

const s3 = new S3Bucket({
	baseUrl: "https://s3.amazonaws.com",
	bucket: "my-bucket",
	accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
	secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
	region: "us-east-1", // optional
	pathStyle: true, // optional
});

// Head an object
await s3.head("path/to/object.txt");

// Get object
const res = await s3.get("path/to/object.txt");
const body = await res.text();

// Put object
await s3.put("path/to/new.txt", "hello world", {
	headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
});

// Delete object
await s3.delete("path/to/new.txt");
```

Constructor options (partial):

- `baseUrl` (string, required): Base endpoint used to build request URLs.
- `bucket` (string, required): Bucket name.
- `pathStyle` (boolean, optional, default false): When true use
  path-style URLs (`baseUrl/<bucket>/<path>`), otherwise use `baseUrl/<path>`.
- `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `sessionToken`, `region` â€” forwarded to
  `aws4fetch`.
