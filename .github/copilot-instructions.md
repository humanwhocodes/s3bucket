# Copilot Instructions

This project is a Node.js library .

## Project Structure

- `src` - Contains all source code
- `tests` - Comprehensive test suite using Mocha

## Code Style and Patterns

### Error Handling

- Use specific error messages: "Expected an array argument.", "Expected at least one entry."
- Throw `TypeError` for type validation, `Error` for business logic
- Always validate inputs at method entry points

## Dependencies and Tools

- Node.js with ES modules
- Mocha for testing
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- JSDoc for type annotations
- TypeScript for type checking

## Testing Requirements

- All new methods need comprehensive tests
- Test both success and error paths
- Verify exact error messages
- Test async behavior and concurrent operations
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Run `npx mocha <filename>` to execute tests for specific files; always do this until all tests pass for this file.
- Run `npm test` to run all tests
- Do not change the working directory when running tests

## Process to Make Changes

1. Understand the existing code and tests
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Run tests to ensure changes work as expected
4. Ensure code adheres to style guidelines
